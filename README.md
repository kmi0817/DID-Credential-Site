## 6. How it works ðŸ™‹

    0) 2 Docker Servers & Flask Server
        - Alice: client
        - Faber: issuer
        - Flask Server: Medium
    1) Alice is connected with Faber when a client enters 'Issue Credential' menu.
        The process of connection:
            Faber Sends Invitation
            Alice receive the Invitation
    3) Alice enters and submits detail information that is needed for the credential.
        The process of making credential:
            Flask Server saves information
            Flask Server requests of issuing credential to Faber
            Flask Server gets credential information: Credential id, Issue date, Issuing authority number, etc.
            Flask Server makes a PDF/PNG format of credential
    4) Alice downloads credential.
